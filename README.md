HapNet.js is a javaScript library to draw haplotype network in a fast way. Unlike other general visualizition libraries, HapNet.js provides a series of features especially designed for visulize haplotype network.

## Features

1. Visualization functions are based on webGL technique([pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)) to accelerate large haplotype network.
